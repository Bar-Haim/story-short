PLACEHOLDER IMAGE SETUP

This file explains how to create the placeholder.png image for the StoryShort application.

REQUIREMENTS:
- File name: placeholder.png
- Location: public/placeholder.png (same directory as this file)
- Format: PNG image
- Size: 1024x1024 pixels (or similar square dimensions)
- Content: Simple, professional placeholder image

CREATION OPTIONS:

1. ONLINE IMAGE GENERATOR:
   - Visit: https://placeholder.com/
   - Generate: 1024x1024 placeholder
   - Download and save as "placeholder.png"

2. DESIGN SOFTWARE:
   - Create a 1024x1024 canvas
   - Fill with a neutral color (e.g., #f0f0f0)
   - Add text: "Image Not Available" or "Placeholder"
   - Export as PNG

3. SIMPLE COLOR BLOCK:
   - Create a 1024x1024 image
   - Fill with a solid color (e.g., light gray #cccccc)
   - Save as PNG

4. AI IMAGE GENERATOR:
   - Use DALL-E, Midjourney, or similar
   - Prompt: "Simple placeholder image, 1024x1024, neutral background, professional"
   - Download and save as "placeholder.png"

PURPOSE:
This placeholder image is used when:
- DALL-E 3 image generation fails
- DALL-E 2 fallback also fails
- Content policy violations occur
- Network or API errors happen

The placeholder ensures the video generation pipeline can continue even when image generation fails, preventing the entire process from stopping due to individual scene failures.
