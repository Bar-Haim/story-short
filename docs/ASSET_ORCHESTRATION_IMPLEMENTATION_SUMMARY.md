# Asset Orchestration Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to implement the asset orchestration system.

## Overview

The asset orchestration system has been successfully implemented to automatically generate missing audio and captions when needed, making the system idempotent and improving user experience.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/tts.ts` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: TTS generation and bucket management
- **Key Functions**:
  - `ensureBucket(name)`: Creates storage bucket if it doesn't exist
  - `generateTTS(video)`: Generates TTS audio using ElevenLabs API and uploads to Supabase
- **Features**:
  - Automatic bucket creation
  - Error handling for missing API keys
  - Comprehensive logging

### 2. `src/lib/captions.ts` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Caption generation and upload
- **Key Functions**:
  - `generateCaptions(video)`: Generates SRT captions with estimated timing
- **Features**:
  - Word count-based duration estimation (150 words/minute)
  - SRT format with proper timestamps
  - Automatic bucket management

### 3. `src/app/api/generate-assets/route.ts`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added imports for new TTS and captions helpers
  - Implemented idempotent behavior for already-generated assets
  - Changed from strict asset gating to proactive generation
  - Added new status states: `render_ready`, `assets_partial`
  - Enhanced response format with detailed asset information
- **New Behavior**:
  - Returns success (200) for already-generated assets
  - Proactively generates missing audio and captions
  - Continues processing even if individual assets fail
  - Provides detailed response with what was generated

### 4. `src/app/api/video-status/route.ts`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added composite readiness checking
  - Added new status handling for `assets_partial` and `render_ready`
  - Enhanced response with `assets` object containing readiness information
- **New Response Fields**:
  ```json
  {
    "assets": {
      "images": 5,
      "audio": true,
      "captions": true,
      "renderReady": true
    }
  }
  ```

### 5. `src/app/finalize/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added support for new status states
  - Enhanced status badges and UI elements
  - Added partial assets action button
  - Updated status help sections
  - Added automatic asset generation trigger on mount
- **New Features**:
  - Automatic asset generation when visiting finalize page
  - Better status visualization
  - Support for `render_ready` status

### 6. `src/app/storyboard/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `handleContinue` function for idempotent behavior
  - Added `pollUntilReady` helper function
  - Enhanced error handling for already-generated assets
- **New Behavior**:
  - Treats already-generated assets as success
  - Proceeds to finalize page immediately when assets are ready
  - Better timeout handling (2 minutes instead of 3 minutes)

## New Status States

1. **`render_ready`**: All assets (images, audio, captions) are ready for rendering
2. **`assets_partial`**: Some assets are ready but not all
3. **`assets_generating`**: Currently generating assets

## API Response Changes

### `/api/generate-assets` Response Format
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "ran": {
    "audio": true,
    "captions": false
  },
  "urls": {
    "audio": "https://...",
    "captions": "https://..."
  },
  "nextStatus": "render_ready",
  "message": "All assets ready for rendering",
  "assets": {
    "images": 5,
    "totalScenes": 5,
    "audio": true,
    "captions": true
  }
}
```

### `/api/video-status` Enhanced Response
```json
{
  "assets": {
    "images": 5,
    "audio": true,
    "captions": true,
    "renderReady": true
  }
}
```

## Storage Buckets

- **`renders-audio`**: Stores generated TTS audio files
- **`renders-captions`**: Stores generated SRT caption files

## Environment Variables

Added to `.env.local`:
```
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=EFbNMe9bCQ0gsl51ZIWn
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to run multiple times
2. **Proactive Generation**: Automatically generates missing assets
3. **Better UX**: Users don't need to manually trigger asset generation
4. **Faster Workflow**: Assets are ready when user reaches finalize page
5. **Reliability**: Individual asset failures don't block the entire process
6. **Transparency**: Clear status and progress information

## Workflow Changes

### Before
1. User manually triggered asset generation
2. All images had to be ready before audio/captions
3. Strict gating between stages

### After
1. Automatic asset generation on finalize page visit
2. Proactive generation of missing assets
3. Flexible status progression
4. Idempotent operations

## Error Handling

- **Missing API Key**: Clear error message with environment check suggestion
- **Asset Generation Failures**: Individual failures don't block other assets
- **Partial Success**: Status reflects what was successfully generated
- **Already Generated**: Returns success instead of error

## Testing

The system can be tested by:
1. Visiting `/finalize/[id]` page
2. Checking that missing assets are automatically generated
3. Verifying idempotent behavior by running asset generation multiple times
4. Confirming status progression to `render_ready`

## Next Steps

1. **Run SQL Script**: Execute `supabase-storage-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL editor
2. **Test Flow**: Visit finalize page to trigger asset generation
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check console for detailed operation logging
4. **Verify Status**: Confirm status progression through new states
