- [ ] **Build Test** - Verify `npm run build` works before cleanup
- [ ] **Reference Check** - Confirm files aren't used by the application
- [ ] **Incremental** - Remove files in small batches, test after each
- [ ] **Document** - Record all decisions and actions taken

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

### NEVER Delete:
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.*`
- `src/**`, `app/**`, `components/**`
- `supabase/**`
- Any file referenced in source code

### When in Doubt:
- **KEEP the file**
