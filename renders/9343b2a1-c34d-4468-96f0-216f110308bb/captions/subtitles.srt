00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,400
their infectious joy and relentless optimism coloring every

00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,599
corner. From frolicking through flower fields to playing

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,800
in the bustling streets of New York, these

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,000
golden creatures spread love and happiness with every

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,199
wag of their tail. On Hawaii's sandy shores,

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,399
they teach us the true meaning of blissful

00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,600
freedom. So, let's take a leaf from our

00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,800
golden friends' book. Spread joy, embrace freedom, and

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,199
make the world a better place!
